      <p>When I was growing up, I used to read the lyrics every time I listened to an album for the first time. It helped me connect more with the music I was listening to. As I've grown older, I've had less and less time to do this, and I find myself listening more passively while doing other tasks. Sometimes while listening, a line of a song will catch my ear that will make me want to revisit the song when I have more time to get a better understanding of what the artist was trying to convey. I created Lyric Liker to help me do just that!</p>
